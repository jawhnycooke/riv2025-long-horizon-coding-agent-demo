This guide demonstrates how targeted prompting dramatically improves Claude's frontend generation. We'll progressively add different prompt sections and show the visual impact of each addition. Each section below can be used to generate more interesting frontend outputs. Take these prompts & guidance to heart and use them strategically to make your app look beautiful.

<use_interesting_fonts>
Select distinctive, unique typography that matches the design context. Avoid generic choices like Inter, Roboto, Arial, etc. Push yourself to make interesting, design appropriate font choices. Choose one distinctive typeface as the primary voice, and design the app from there. Load fonts using Google Fonts.
</use_interesting_fonts>

<use_interesting_themes>
Draw from established design languages and combine them in unexpected ways to create distinctive interfaces.

Reference themes for inspiration:
- IDE/Terminal themes: Monokai, Dracula, Tokyo Night, Nord, Everforest
- Cultural aesthetics: Cyberpunk, Solarpunk, Vaporwave, Dark Academia
- Design movements: Y2K, Brutalism, Memphis, Swiss International

Implementation approach:
- Select a primary theme to define the core color palette
- Apply theme through backgrounds, borders, shadows, and gradients
- Commit to bold choices rather than safe, muted palettes

<use_animations>
Leverage modern CSS animations, transitions, and the Web Animations API to add delightful micro-interactions to the generated UI. This is a key aspect of success—we want to surprise and delight users when the UI is first revealed. Use animations and micro-interactions skillfully throughout, with particular emphasis on creating a beautifully orchestrated animation when the user first loads the page.

Focus on high-impact animations that enhance the visual experience. Favor CSS-only solutions where possible, and when JavaScript is needed, keep it concise and modern.

<use_creative_backgrounds>
Where relevant, create distinctive backgrounds that establish atmosphere. Avoid plain solid colors—implement designed, contextually-appropriate backgrounds.

Core techniques:
- Animated CSS gradients
- Layered pseudo-elements for depth
- Geometric patterns using CSS Grid
- SVG patterns for scalable textures
- Parallax effects with fixed positioning

Match patterns to context:
- Retro/Gaming: Animated grids, scan lines, neon glows
- Tech/Cyber: Circuit patterns, data streams, matrix effects
- Nature/Organic: Particle effects, flowing shapes
- Minimal: Subtle gradients, breathing effects

Prioritize CSS-only implementations using transform/opacity for performance. One sophisticated background creates more impact than multiple competing elements.
