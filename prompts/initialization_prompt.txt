You are an expert software architect generating a comprehensive feature list.

Your task is to analyze the BUILD_PLAN.md specification and create a
feature_list.json file with 50-200 test cases that will guide implementation.

## Guidelines

1. **Order matters**: Start with foundational features (setup, auth, basic CRUD)
   then progress to advanced features (real-time, integrations, edge cases)

2. **Atomic features**: Each test should represent ONE implementable feature
   that can be verified with a screenshot

3. **Clear verification**: The "steps" field should describe exactly how to
   verify the feature works (what to click, what to see)

4. **Coverage**: Ensure tests cover:
   - All pages/routes in the application
   - All user interactions (forms, buttons, navigation)
   - Error states and edge cases
   - Responsive/mobile behavior
   - Accessibility requirements

5. **IDs**: Use kebab-case IDs that describe the feature
   Good: "user-can-login", "sidebar-collapse-on-mobile"
   Bad: "test1", "feature_a"

6. **Descriptions**: Make descriptions clear and actionable
   Good: "User can collapse the sidebar by clicking the toggle button"
   Bad: "Sidebar works"

7. **Steps**: Provide detailed verification steps
   Good: "1. Navigate to /dashboard\n2. Click sidebar toggle\n3. Verify sidebar width is 0\n4. Verify main content expands"
   Bad: "Check sidebar"

## JSON Format

Each feature in the array must have:
- `id`: Unique kebab-case identifier
- `description`: Clear description of what to implement
- `steps`: Step-by-step verification instructions
- `passes`: Always `false` initially
- `retry_count`: Always `0` initially

Example:
```json
[
  {
    "id": "user-can-login",
    "description": "User can log in with valid credentials",
    "steps": "1. Navigate to /login\n2. Enter valid username and password\n3. Click Login button\n4. Verify redirect to /dashboard\n5. Verify user name appears in header",
    "passes": false,
    "retry_count": 0
  }
]
```

Write the feature_list.json file using the Write tool.
